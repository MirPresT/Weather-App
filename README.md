# Weather App
####[Live Demo](http://codepen.io/MirPresT/full/oXJOqW) is available on CodePen!

*A weather app created while working through FCC*

####Functionality
On the initial load of the browser, the app will ask the user if it can access their location. Upon successfully acquiring the location, the app makes an ajax request to OpenWeatherMap.Org for both the current weather and forecast.

Icons are displayed based on information in the successfully acquired json data.
Clicking the switch at the bottom will switch all values to Celcius.

A search bar is located at the top and can be used to load data from other cities. If the switch is celcius when the search is made then the appropriate temperatures will display. Search e.g. Chicago,US

#### Frameworks
